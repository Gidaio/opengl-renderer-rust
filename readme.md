# Simple OpenGL Renderer
I made this because I wanted to learn OpenGL, but I've found that when following tutorials, it's better to do it in a different language than the tutorial to better internalize it.

Instead of C/C++, I used Rust, because it met some of the requirements of a language I wanted to use, namely:
- It didn't have a garbage collector, so I'd have to manage memory myself.
- It was easy to use and had a good ecosystem.
- It had a cleaner syntax than C++.

ESDF can be used to move (I'm a weirdo, and yes, I actually play games like that), and Shift/Space are to move down/up.
